        "This is the first book in the Bloodlines of Atmos series, and book one in the Jace trilogy.",
        "Being the only survivor in a tragic car accident that claimed his entire family, 6-year-old Jace starts a new life in the Sanctuary for Orphaned Children - a place that seems like a comfortable and luxurious dream to those on the outside, but with a world so drastically different for those on the inside.",
        "After a painful first day, Jace discovers he is surrounded by violence and torment, and isolates himself from the world around him, only to later embrace the combative lifestyle he would grow up in.  But when his simple life gets disrupted by a kid with strange abilities, Jace is forced to put his trust in others, and wage a personal war against those who possess unnatural powers.",
        "He will discover strange magic and technology.",
        "He will discover plots and oddities about the establishment.",
        "He will discover that he is the savior for all humanity."
